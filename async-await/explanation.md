This code demonstrates how to use **async/await** in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations and error handling in an easy-to-read manner. Letâ€™s break it down step by step.

---

### **1. The `delayFn` Function**
```javascript
function delayFn(time) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, time));
}
```
- **What it does**:
    - Takes a `time` parameter (in milliseconds).
    - Returns a **Promise** that resolves after the specified time using `setTimeout`.

- **Purpose**:
    - To create a delay before continuing execution.

---

### **2. The `delayedGreet` Function**
```javascript
async function delayedGreet(name) {
  await delayFn(2000);
  console.log(`Hii ${name}`);
}

delayedGreet("Pranay");
```
- **What it does**:
    - An **async function** that delays execution for 2 seconds (2000 milliseconds) and then prints a greeting with the provided `name`.

- **How it works**:
    1. The `await delayFn(2000)` waits for `delayFn` to resolve after 2 seconds.
    2. After the delay, it executes `console.log` to print the greeting.

- **Execution**:
    - When you call `delayedGreet("Pranay")`, it waits for 2 seconds before printing:
      ```
      Hii Pranay
      ```

### **3. The `divisionFn` Function**
```javascript
async function divisionFn(num1, num2) {
  try {
    if (num2 === 0) throw new Error("Cannot divide by zero");
    return num1 / num2;
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("Some error occurred", e);
    return null;
  }
}
```
- **What it does**:
    - Asynchronously divides `num1` by `num2`.
    - If `num2` is `0`, it throws an error.
    - Uses a **try-catch block** to handle errors gracefully.

- **How it works**:
    1. If `num2` is not zero, it returns the division result.
    2. If `num2` is zero:
        - Throws an error using `throw new Error("Cannot divide by zero")`.
        - The **catch block** handles the error by printing it to the console and returning `null`.

---

### **4. The `mainFn` Function**
```javascript
async function mainFn() {
  console.log(await divisionFn(10, 5));
  console.log(await divisionFn(10, 0));
}
mainFn();
```
- **What it does**:
    - Calls `divisionFn` with different arguments and waits for its result using `await`.
    - Prints the result of each `divisionFn` call.

- **Execution Flow**:
    1. Calls `divisionFn(10, 5)`:
        - Since `num2 = 5`, no error is thrown.
        - Returns `10 / 5 = 2`.
        - `mainFn` prints: `2`.

    2. Calls `divisionFn(10, 0)`:
        - Since `num2 = 0`, an error is thrown.
        - The **catch block** logs the error:
          ```
          Some error occurred Error: Cannot divide by zero
          ```
        - Returns `null`, so `mainFn` prints: `null`.

---

### **Output**
**Console Output**:
```
Hii Pranay
2
Some error occurred Error: Cannot divide by zero
null
```

### **Key Concepts Demonstrated**

1. **`async/await`**:
    - Used to write asynchronous code in a synchronous style for better readability.
    - `await` pauses the execution until the Promise resolves.

2. **Error Handling with `try-catch`**:
    - Catches errors inside `async` functions.
    - Prevents the program from crashing by handling errors gracefully.

3. **Custom Delays**:
    - `delayFn` shows how to create a delay using Promises.

4. **Chaining Asynchronous Calls**:
    - `mainFn` demonstrates sequential execution of asynchronous functions using `await`.
