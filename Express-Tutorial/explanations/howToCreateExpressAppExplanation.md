Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of the code:

---

### **1. Importing the `express` module**
```javascript
const express = require("express");
```
- **`express`**: A popular Node.js framework for building web applications and APIs.
- This imports the `express` module so you can use it in your application.

---

### **2. Creating an Express application**
```javascript
const app = express();
```
- The `express()` function creates an instance of an Express application.
- This `app` object is used to define routes, middleware, and other application logic.

---

### **3. Defining a route for the root URL ("/")**
```javascript
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.send("Hello world");
});
```
- **`app.get(path, callback)`**:
    - This defines a route that listens for GET requests at the specified `path` (in this case, the root path `/`).

- **Callback function `(req, res)`**:
    - `req` (request): Contains information about the HTTP request.
    - `res` (response): Used to send a response to the client.

- **`res.send("Hello world")`**:
    - Sends the text `"Hello world"` as the HTTP response when the root URL `/` is accessed.

---

### **4. Setting the port number**
```javascript
const port = 3000;
```
- The application will listen for requests on port `3000`.
- The port is a communication endpoint. You can change it if needed (e.g., `8080` or any available port).

---

### **5. Starting the server**
```javascript
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running at ${port}`);
});
```
- **`app.listen(port, callback)`**:
    - Starts the server and listens for incoming requests on the specified `port` (3000).
    - Once the server starts successfully, the callback function logs a message indicating that the server is running.

---

### **How it works together**:
1. The Express application is created.
2. A route is set up to handle GET requests at the root URL (`/`) and send back the response `"Hello world"`.
3. The server starts listening on port `3000`.
4. When a user accesses `http://localhost:3000` in a browser or sends a GET request to `/`, the server responds with:
   ```
   Hello world
   ```

---

### **Output in Terminal**:
When you run this script, the terminal displays:
```
Server is running at 3000
```

### **Output in Browser**:
When you visit `http://localhost:3000`, the browser shows:
```
Hello world
```

This code is a simple Express application that demonstrates how to set up a basic web server and respond to client requests.
