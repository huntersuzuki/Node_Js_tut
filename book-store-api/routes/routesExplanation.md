This code defines an **Express router** that maps HTTP routes to specific controller functions for managing book-related operations. Here's a detailed breakdown of the code:

---

### **1. Importing Required Modules**
```javascript
const express = require("express");
const {
  getAllBooks,
  getBookById,
  addNewBook,
  updateBook,
  deleteBook,
} = require("../controllers/bookController.js");
```
- **`express`**: A lightweight web application framework for Node.js, used to build APIs and web applications.
    - The `express.Router()` method allows grouping related routes together.
- **`bookController.js`**: This file exports controller functions (defined earlier) to handle book operations like fetching, adding, updating, and deleting books.

---

### **2. Creating the Express Router**
```javascript
const router = express.Router();
```
- **`express.Router()`**: Creates a new router instance for defining and organizing routes.
- The router helps modularize code by separating the routing logic into smaller, manageable units.

---

### **3. Defining Routes for Book Operations**
The router maps HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and endpoints to their respective controller functions.

#### a. **Route: Fetch All Books**
```javascript
router.get("/books", getAllBooks);
```
- **HTTP Method**: `GET`
- **Endpoint**: `/books`
- **Purpose**: Calls the `getAllBooks` function to retrieve all books from the database.
- **Example Usage**:
    - Client sends a `GET` request to `/books`.
    - Server responds with a list of all books.

---

#### b. **Route: Fetch a Single Book by ID**
```javascript
router.get("/book/:id", getBookById);
```
- **HTTP Method**: `GET`
- **Endpoint**: `/book/:id`
- **Purpose**: Calls the `getBookById` function to retrieve a single book using its unique ID.
- **Dynamic Segment**: `:id`
    - `:id` is a placeholder for the book's unique identifier.
    - The actual value is passed as `req.params.id` to the controller.
- **Example Usage**:
    - Client sends a `GET` request to `/book/12345`.
    - Server responds with details of the book with ID `12345`.

---

#### c. **Route: Add a New Book**
```javascript
router.post("/add", addNewBook);
```
- **HTTP Method**: `POST`
- **Endpoint**: `/add`
- **Purpose**: Calls the `addNewBook` function to add a new book to the database.
- **Example Usage**:
    - Client sends a `POST` request to `/add` with book data in the request body (`req.body`).
    - Server creates the book and responds with success or error.

---

#### d. **Route: Update an Existing Book**
```javascript
router.put("/update/:id", updateBook);
```
- **HTTP Method**: `PUT`
- **Endpoint**: `/update/:id`
- **Purpose**: Calls the `updateBook` function to update a book's details by its unique ID.
- **Dynamic Segment**: `:id`
    - Represents the ID of the book to be updated.
    - Passed to the controller as `req.params.id`.
- **Example Usage**:
    - Client sends a `PUT` request to `/update/12345` with updated data in the request body.
    - Server updates the book with ID `12345` and responds with success or error.

---

#### e. **Route: Delete a Book**
```javascript
router.delete("/delete/:id", deleteBook);
```
- **HTTP Method**: `DELETE`
- **Endpoint**: `/delete/:id`
- **Purpose**: Calls the `deleteBook` function to remove a book from the database by its ID.
- **Dynamic Segment**: `:id`
    - Represents the ID of the book to be deleted.
    - Passed to the controller as `req.params.id`.
- **Example Usage**:
    - Client sends a `DELETE` request to `/delete/12345`.
    - Server deletes the book with ID `12345` and responds with success or error.

---

### **4. Exporting the Router**
```javascript
module.exports = router;
```
- The router is exported as a module so it can be integrated into the main application.

---

### **Integration with the Main Application**
The router is typically used in the main server file (e.g., `app.js` or `server.js`) like this:
```javascript
const express = require("express");
const bookRoutes = require("./routes/bookRoutes");

const app = express();
app.use(express.json()); // Middleware to parse JSON request bodies
app.use("/api", bookRoutes); // Prefix routes with "/api"

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on http://localhost:3000");
});
```

- **Explanation**:
    - **`app.use("/api", bookRoutes)`**: Attaches the router to the `/api` path.
        - Example: A request to `/api/books` triggers the `getAllBooks` controller.
    - The server listens on port `3000` and handles requests using the routes defined in the `bookRoutes` router.

---

### **Benefits of Using Express Router**
1. **Code Modularity**: Separates routing logic from the main application logic.
2. **Scalability**: Allows easy management of routes as the application grows.
3. **Middleware Integration**: Enables applying middleware (e.g., authentication) to specific routes or groups of routes.
