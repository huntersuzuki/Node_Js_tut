This code sets up an Express.js server that connects to a MongoDB database and handles book-related routes. Here's a detailed breakdown:

---

### **1. Importing Required Modules**
```javascript
require("dotenv").config();
const express = require("express");
const connectDB = require("./database/db.js");
const bookRoutes = require("./routes/bookRoutes.js");
```

#### a. **`dotenv`**
- Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
- **Purpose**: Securely store sensitive information like the `PORT`, database connection strings, etc., outside of the codebase.

#### b. **`express`**
- Framework for building APIs and web applications in Node.js.
- Provides tools for defining routes, handling middleware, and managing HTTP requests.

#### c. **`connectDB`**
- The database connection function (defined in `./database/db.js`) is imported here to establish the connection to MongoDB.

#### d. **`bookRoutes`**
- Router module (defined in `./routes/bookRoutes.js`) contains all the book-related endpoints.

---

### **2. Creating the Express Application**
```javascript
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
```

#### a. **`app`**
- Instance of an Express application used to define middleware, routes, and server settings.

#### b. **`PORT`**
- Dynamically retrieves the port number from the environment variable `PORT` via `process.env.PORT`.
- If `PORT` is not defined, defaults to `3000`.

---

### **3. Connecting to the Database**
```javascript
connectDB();
```

- Calls the `connectDB` function to establish a connection to the MongoDB database.
- This ensures the database is connected before handling any API requests.
- If the connection fails, the server will log an error and terminate (based on the `connectDB` function logic).

---

### **4. Adding Middleware**
```javascript
app.use(express.json());
```

#### **Express Middleware**
- **`express.json()`**: Parses incoming JSON requests and makes the data available in `req.body`.
- Necessary for handling POST, PUT, or PATCH requests that send JSON payloads.

---

### **5. Defining Routes**
```javascript
app.use("/api/books", bookRoutes);
```

- **Purpose**: Mounts the `bookRoutes` router at the `/api/books` path.
    - For example:
        - A request to `/api/books` is routed to `getAllBooks`.
        - A request to `/api/books/123` (where `123` is an ID) is routed to `getBookById`.

#### **How it Works**
1. **Route Prefix**: `/api/books` is the base path for all book-related routes.
2. **bookRoutes**:
    - Contains detailed route definitions for actions like adding, updating, or deleting books.

---

### **6. Starting the Server**
```javascript
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log("Server is running at port", PORT);
});
```

- **`app.listen(PORT, callback)`**:
    - Starts the server and listens for incoming requests on the specified `PORT`.
    - Once the server starts, the callback logs a message indicating the server is running.

#### **Dynamic Port Handling**
- **`process.env.PORT || 3000`**:
    - Uses the `PORT` environment variable if defined (useful for deployment environments like Heroku or AWS).
    - Defaults to `3000` for local development.

---

### **Behavior of the Application**
1. **Startup**:
    - The database connection is established using `connectDB`.
    - Middleware for parsing JSON requests is added.
    - Routes for handling book-related operations are loaded.
    - The server starts listening on the specified `PORT`.

2. **API Endpoints**:
    - The `/api/books` routes (defined in `bookRoutes.js`) are available to handle CRUD operations for books.

3. **Error Handling**:
    - If the database connection fails, the server terminates (as per the `connectDB` logic).
    - If the server fails to start, errors will appear in the console.

---

### **Example Workflow**
1. **Startup**:
    - Run the server with `node app.js` or `npm start`.
    - Console output: `MongoDB Connected` (from `connectDB`) and `Server is running at port 3000`.

2. **Request Handling**:
    - Example: A `GET` request to `/api/books` triggers the `getAllBooks` function.
    - Example: A `POST` request to `/api/books/add` with book data in `req.body` adds a new book.

---

### **Best Practices Illustrated**
1. **Environment Variables**:
    - Uses `dotenv` to store sensitive data like `PORT` or database connection strings.
2. **Separation of Concerns**:
    - Database connection, routes, and main server logic are separated into individual modules.
3. **Scalability**:
    - Adding new routes or features (e.g., author management) is straightforward by creating new router modules.

### **Example `.env` File**
```plaintext
PORT=5000
DB_CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/bookstoreDB
