This code defines an **Express.js route** for an endpoint `/welcome` that is accessible only to authenticated users with an **admin role**. It uses two middleware functions (`authMiddleware` and `adminMiddleware`) to enforce these restrictions. Here's a detailed explanation:

---

### **1. Importing Required Modules**
```javascript
const express = require("express");
const authMiddelware = require("../middleware/authMiddleWare");
const adminMiddleware = require("../middleware/adminMiddleWare");
```

- **`express`**: The Express framework is used to define the router and manage HTTP requests.
- **`authMiddleware`**:
    - Ensures the user is authenticated by verifying the provided **JSON Web Token (JWT)**.
    - This middleware protects the route by blocking unauthorized requests.
- **`adminMiddleware`**:
    - Ensures the user has an **admin role**.
    - This middleware checks the `role` property in the request object (set by `authMiddleware`) to confirm the user has admin rights.

---

### **2. Creating a Router Instance**
```javascript
const router = express.Router();
```
- **Purpose**: Creates a new router instance to handle the `/welcome` route.
- **Benefit**: Allows you to organize routes into separate modules, improving the code structure and maintainability.

---

### **3. Defining the `/welcome` Route**
```javascript
router.get("/welcome", authMiddelware, adminMiddleware, (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({
    success: true,
    message: "Welcome to the admin page",
  });
});
```

#### **Route Method and Path**
- **HTTP Method**: `GET`
    - This route is accessed with a GET request, which is commonly used to retrieve information.
- **Path**: `/welcome`
    - This is the endpoint that users access to reach the "Welcome to the admin page" message.

---

### **4. Middleware in Action**

#### **`authMiddleware`**
- **Purpose**: Validates the user's **JWT** to confirm their authentication status.
- **Steps Performed by `authMiddleware`**:
    1. Extracts the token from the `Authorization` header of the request.
    2. Verifies the token using a secret key (e.g., `process.env.JWT_SECRET_KEY`).
    3. If valid, attaches the decoded user information (e.g., `role`, `userID`, `email`) to the `req` object as `req.userInfo`.
    4. Calls the `next()` function to proceed to the next middleware or route handler.
    5. If invalid or missing, returns an error response (e.g., "Access Denied").

#### **`adminMiddleware`**
- **Purpose**: Checks if the authenticated user has an `admin` role.
- **Steps Performed by `adminMiddleware`**:
    1. Reads the `role` from `req.userInfo` (set by `authMiddleware`).
    2. If `role` is `"admin"`, the middleware calls `next()` to allow access to the route.
    3. If `role` is not `"admin"`, it returns an error response with a `403 Forbidden` status.

### **5. Route Handler**
```javascript
(req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({
    success: true,
    message: "Welcome to the admin page",
  });
}
```

- **Purpose**: Sends a successful response back to the client when the user is authenticated and has admin rights.
- **Response**:
    - **`status(200)`**: HTTP status code indicating the request was successful.
    - **`json()`**: Sends a JSON object as the response body.
    - Response Body:
      ```json
      {
        "success": true,
        "message": "Welcome to the admin page"
      }
      ```

---

### **6. Exporting the Router**
```javascript
module.exports = router;
```
- **Purpose**: Makes the router available to other parts of the application for integration.
- **Usage**:
    - Typically, this router would be mounted on a specific base path in the main application file (`app.js` or `server.js`).

#### **Example Mounting in the Main Application**
```javascript
const express = require("express");
const adminRoutes = require("./routes/adminRoutes");
const app = express();

app.use("/admin", adminRoutes); // Mounts this router at the "/admin" path

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 3000");
});
```

- **Resulting Endpoint**: The `/welcome` route is accessible at `/admin/welcome`.

---

### **7. Request Flow**
1. A client sends a `GET` request to `/admin/welcome`.
2. The `authMiddleware`:
    - Validates the user's token.
    - Decodes the token to retrieve user information and attaches it to `req.userInfo`.
3. The `adminMiddleware`:
    - Checks `req.userInfo.role` to confirm the user is an admin.
4. If both middlewares pass:
    - The route handler sends the success response: `Welcome to the admin page`.
5. If either middleware fails:
    - An error response (e.g., `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden`) is sent to the client.

---

### **Advantages of This Design**
1. **Security**:
    - Protects the route with two layers of checks: authentication and role-based authorization.
2. **Reusability**:
    - `authMiddleware` and `adminMiddleware` can be reused across multiple routes requiring authentication and admin access.
3. **Modularity**:
    - Separates middleware and route logic into different files, making the codebase easier to manage.
4. **Scalability**:
    - Adding new routes or roles (e.g., "moderator") is straightforward with middleware.

### **Key Security Considerations**
1. **Token Validation**:
    - Ensure that the JWT is signed with a strong, secret key and stored securely (e.g., in an environment variable).
2. **Least Privilege Principle**:
    - Restrict sensitive routes (e.g., `/admin/welcome`) to only users who genuinely need access.
3. **Error Handling**:
    - Provide informative but non-revealing error messages to prevent leaking sensitive information.

By implementing this structure, you create a secure and modular system for protecting sensitive routes in your application.
