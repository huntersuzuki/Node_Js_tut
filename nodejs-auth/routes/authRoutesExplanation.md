The provided code defines an **Express.js router** for managing user authentication-related operations in a web application. Here's a brief summary:

### **Purpose**
To handle user registration, login, and password change operations securely.

### **Features**
1. **User Registration (`POST /register`)**:
    - Allows new users to create an account.
    - Handles data validation and securely stores user details in the database.

2. **User Login (`POST /login`)**:
    - Authenticates users by verifying their credentials.
    - Generates and returns a token (e.g., JWT) for session management.

3. **Change Password (`POST /change-password`)**:
    - Allows authenticated users to update their password securely.
    - Uses `authMiddleware` to ensure only logged-in users can access this route.

### **Key Components**
- **Middleware**:
    - `authMiddleware`: Verifies if the user is logged in and authorized.
- **Controller Functions**:
    - `registerUser`, `loginUser`, `changePassword`: Handle the core logic for each route.

### **Usage**
The router can be mounted to a specific endpoint (e.g., `/api/auth`) in the main application file, organizing authentication functionality in a modular and maintainable way.

### **1. Importing Dependencies**
```javascript
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();
const {
  loginUser,
  registerUser,
  changePassword,
} = require("../controllers/authController");
const authMiddelware = require("../middleware/authMiddleWare");
```

#### **Explanation**:
1. **`express`**:
    - Used to create an Express router, which organizes the application's routes into modular and reusable pieces.
    - `router = express.Router()` creates a new instance of a router.

2. **Controller Functions**:
    - `loginUser`: Handles user login by verifying credentials and returning an authentication token.
    - `registerUser`: Handles user registration by creating a new user in the database.
    - `changePassword`: Allows authenticated users to change their password.

3. **`authMiddleware`**:
    - Middleware to verify if a user is authenticated (i.e., logged in).
    - Ensures only authorized users can access certain routes, such as changing passwords.

### **2. Route Definitions**
#### **Route 1: User Registration**
```javascript
router.post("/register", registerUser);
```
- **HTTP Method**: `POST`
- **Path**: `/register`
- **Purpose**:
    - Allows new users to create an account.
    - Typically involves validating input data (e.g., email, password) and saving the user in the database.
- **Controller Function**: `registerUser`
    - Handles the business logic for:
        - Validating user input.
        - Checking if the user already exists (based on email or username).
        - Hashing the password for security.
        - Saving the user in the database.
        - Responding with a success or error message.

---

#### **Route 2: User Login**
```javascript
router.post("/login", loginUser);
```
- **HTTP Method**: `POST`
- **Path**: `/login`
- **Purpose**:
    - Authenticates users and provides a token for session management (e.g., JWT).
- **Controller Function**: `loginUser`
    - Handles the business logic for:
        - Validating credentials (e.g., matching email and password).
        - Generating a secure token (e.g., JWT) if authentication is successful.
        - Returning the token and user information in the response.

---

#### **Route 3: Change Password**
```javascript
router.post("/change-password", authMiddelware, changePassword);
```
- **HTTP Method**: `POST`
- **Path**: `/change-password`
- **Middleware**:
    - **`authMiddleware`**:
        - Ensures the user is authenticated (e.g., checks if a valid token is provided in the request).
        - Without this middleware, unauthenticated users could potentially change passwords.
- **Purpose**:
    - Allows logged-in users to change their password securely.
- **Controller Function**: `changePassword`
    - Handles the business logic for:
        - Verifying the user's identity (e.g., using the token).
        - Validating the new password (e.g., length, complexity).
        - Updating the password in the database (usually after hashing it).
        - Responding with a success or error message.

---

### **3. Exporting the Router**
```javascript
module.exports = router;
```
- This line makes the router available for use in other parts of the application.
- In the main server file (e.g., `app.js`), the router can be mounted like this:
  ```javascript
  const authRoutes = require("./routes/authRoutes");
  app.use("/api/auth", authRoutes);
  ```
    - This makes the routes accessible via endpoints like `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`, and `/api/auth/change-password`.

---

### **Key Points**
1. **Modular Design**:
    - Routes are organized in a separate file to maintain clean and readable code.
    - The router can be easily expanded or reused.

2. **Middleware**:
    - The `authMiddleware` ensures that only logged-in users can access sensitive operations (e.g., changing passwords).

3. **Security**:
    - Ensures user authentication and proper handling of sensitive data, such as passwords.
    - Passwords are typically hashed before being stored in the database.

4. **Scalability**:
    - New authentication-related routes can be added without affecting unrelated parts of the application.

---

### **Summary**
This router handles user authentication and account management:
- **Register**: Creates a new user account.
- **Login**: Authenticates users and issues a token.
- **Change Password**: Secures password updates for authenticated users.

The middleware (`authMiddleware`) ensures that sensitive actions like changing passwords are restricted to logged-in users. This modular and secure design makes it easy to maintain and expand.
