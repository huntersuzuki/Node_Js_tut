Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of the code:

---

### **1. Importing the `events` module**
```javascript
const eventEmitter = require("events");
```
- The `events` module in Node.js provides a way to create and manage events.
- `eventEmitter` is the main class from the `events` module, which allows us to create event-driven functionality.

---

### **2. Creating an event emitter instance**
```javascript
const myFirstEventEmitter = new eventEmitter();
```
- This creates an object `myFirstEventEmitter` from the `eventEmitter` class.
- `myFirstEventEmitter` can emit (trigger) events and listen for those events.

---

### **3. Setting up an event listener**
```javascript
myFirstEventEmitter.on("greet", (name) => {
  console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
});
```
- **`on("greet", callback)`**:
    - This sets up a listener for the `"greet"` event.
    - When the `"greet"` event is emitted, the provided callback function is executed.
    - The callback function takes an argument `name` and logs a greeting message: `Hello ${name}`.

---

### **4. Emitting the `"greet"` event**
```javascript
myFirstEventEmitter.emit("greet", "Pranay");
```
- **`emit("greet", "Pranay")`**:
    - This triggers the `"greet"` event and passes the string `"Pranay"` as data.
    - The event listener set up earlier (`on("greet", ...)`) receives this data.
    - The callback function executes, logging:
      ```plaintext
      Hello Pranay
      ```

---

### **How the code works together**:
1. The `eventEmitter` module is imported to manage events.
2. An instance of `eventEmitter` is created, allowing custom event handling.
3. A listener is set up for the `"greet"` event to log a message when the event is emitted.
4. The `"greet"` event is emitted with the name `"Pranay"`, triggering the listener to log the greeting.

---

### **Output**:
```
Hello Pranay
```

This is a simple demonstration of how to use the `events` module to create and respond to custom events in Node.js.
