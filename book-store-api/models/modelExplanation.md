This code defines a **Mongoose schema** and model for managing data related to books in a MongoDB database. Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

---

### **1. Importing Mongoose**
```javascript
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
```
- **Mongoose**: A Node.js library that provides a schema-based solution for modeling MongoDB data.
- The `require("mongoose")` imports the Mongoose module to use its functionality in this file.

---

### **2. Defining a Schema**
```javascript
const bookSchema = mongoose.Schema({
  title: { ... },
  author: { ... },
  year: { ... },
  createdAt: { ... },
});
```
- A **schema** defines the structure of documents stored in a MongoDB collection. It specifies fields, their types, and validation rules.

#### a. **`title` Field**
```javascript
title: {
  type: String,
  required: [true, "Book title is required"],
  trim: true,
  maxLength: [100, "Book title should not exceed 100 characters"],
}
```
- **`type: String`**: Specifies that the `title` field must contain a string value.
- **`required: [true, "Book title is required"]`**: Marks this field as mandatory. If omitted, Mongoose will throw an error with the specified message.
- **`trim: true`**: Removes leading and trailing whitespace from the input.
- **`maxLength: [100, "Book title should not exceed 100 characters"]`**: Limits the length of the title to 100 characters. If exceeded, an error will be thrown.

---

#### b. **`author` Field**
```javascript
author: {
  type: String,
  required: [true, "Author name is required"],
  trim: true,
}
```
- Similar to the `title` field, this field:
    - Requires a string value (`type: String`).
    - Is mandatory (`required`).
    - Removes extra whitespace (`trim`).

---

#### c. **`year` Field**
```javascript
year: {
  type: String,
  required: [true, "Publication year is required"],
  min: [1000, "Invalid year"],
  max: [new Date().getFullYear(), "Invalid year"],
}
```
- **`type: String`**: Specifies that the publication year is stored as a string.
- **`required: [true, "Publication year is required"]`**: Ensures the field is mandatory.
- **`min: [1000, "Invalid year"]`**: Validates that the year cannot be earlier than 1000.
- **`max: [new Date().getFullYear(), "Invalid year"]`**: Ensures the year does not exceed the current year.

---

#### d. **`createdAt` Field**
```javascript
createdAt: {
  type: Date,
  default: Date.now,
}
```
- **`type: Date`**: Specifies that this field will store a date value.
- **`default: Date.now`**: Automatically assigns the current date and time when a document is created.

---

### **3. Exporting the Model**
```javascript
module.exports = mongoose.model("Book", bookSchema);
```
- **`mongoose.model("Book", bookSchema)`**:
    - Creates a model named **`Book`** based on the `bookSchema`.
    - The model provides an interface to interact with the `books` collection in the MongoDB database.
    - Mongoose automatically pluralizes the model name (`Book`) to derive the collection name (`books`).
- **`module.exports`**:
    - Exports the model so it can be imported and used in other files.

---

### **Validation and Behavior Summary**
1. The schema ensures data integrity by enforcing rules such as required fields, character limits, and valid year ranges.
2. When new `Book` documents are created, Mongoose:
    - Validates the data against the schema.
    - Adds a `createdAt` timestamp if not explicitly provided.

### **Example Usage**
```javascript
const Book = require("./path-to-book-model");

// Creating a new book
const newBook = new Book({
  title: "The Great Gatsby",
  author: "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
  year: "1925",
});

newBook.save()
  .then(() => console.log("Book saved!"))
  .catch(err => console.log("Error:", err.message));
```
This code would save a new document to the `books` collection, provided it passes the validation rules.
