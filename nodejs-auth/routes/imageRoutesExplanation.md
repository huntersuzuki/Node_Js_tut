The code defines an **Express.js router** to manage image-related operations in a web application. It includes routes and middleware for handling authentication, role-based access, file uploads, and image data management. Here's a brief summary of its functionality:

### **Purpose**
To handle uploading, fetching, and deleting images securely and efficiently.

### **Features**
1. **Image Upload (`POST /upload`)**:
    - Only accessible by authenticated admin users.
    - Allows uploading a single image using `uploadMiddleware`.
    - Saves the image to Cloudinary and stores metadata in a database.

2. **Fetch Images (`GET /images`)**:
    - Accessible by any authenticated user.
    - Fetches images with support for **pagination** and **sorting** to optimize data retrieval.

3. **Delete Image (`DELETE /delete/:id`)**:
    - Only accessible by authenticated admin users.
    - Deletes an image from Cloudinary and its associated record from the database.
    - Verifies that the user deleting the image has proper ownership or admin rights.

### **Key Concepts**
- **Middleware**:
    - `authMiddleware`: Ensures the user is logged in.
    - `adminMiddleware`: Restricts certain actions to admin users.
    - `uploadMiddleware`: Handles image file uploads (e.g., using `multer`).

- **Controller Functions**:
    - `uploadImage`: Handles the upload process and saves metadata.
    - `getImages`: Fetches a list of images from the database with pagination.
    - `deleteImage`: Removes an image both from storage (Cloudinary) and the database.

### **Usage**
The router is modular, allowing it to be imported and mounted to a specific endpoint in the main server file (e.g., `/api/images`). This design ensures clean code organization and scalability.

Here's a detailed explanation of the code.

### **1. Importing Dependencies**
```javascript
const express = require("express");
const authMiddelware = require("../middleware/authMiddleWare");
const adminMiddleware = require("../middleware/adminMiddleWare");
const uploadMiddleware = require("../middleware/uploadImageMiddleware");
const {
  uploadImage,
  getImages,
  deleteImage,
} = require("../controllers/imageController");
```

- **`express`**: A Node.js framework used to create and manage the applicationâ€™s routing.
- **Middleware Imports**:
    - `authMiddleware`: Handles authentication. Ensures that the user making the request is logged in and authorized to access specific routes.
    - `adminMiddleware`: Checks if the logged-in user has administrative privileges.
    - `uploadMiddleware`: Middleware responsible for handling image file uploads (likely using a library like `multer` to handle `multipart/form-data`).
- **Controller Imports**:
    - `uploadImage`: Function responsible for uploading images (from `imageController.js`).
    - `getImages`: Function for fetching images, including pagination and sorting.
    - `deleteImage`: Function for deleting images, ensuring authorization and permissions.

### **2. Router Setup**
```javascript
const router = express.Router();
```
- **`router`**: Creates a new router object, allowing you to define routes separately and keep the code modular.
- This router handles image-related operations (`upload`, `fetch`, and `delete`).

---

### **3. Route: Image Upload**
```javascript
router.post(
  "/upload",
  authMiddelware,
  adminMiddleware,
  uploadMiddleware.single("image"),
  uploadImage,
);
```
#### **Route Details**:
- **HTTP Method**: `POST`.
- **Path**: `/upload`.
- **Middleware**:
    1. **`authMiddleware`**:
        - Verifies if the request contains a valid token and the user is authenticated.
        - Ensures only logged-in users can access this route.
    2. **`adminMiddleware`**:
        - Ensures that only admin users (users with elevated privileges) are allowed to upload images.
    3. **`uploadMiddleware.single("image")`**:
        - Handles file uploads, specifically expecting a single file with the field name `"image"`.
        - Likely utilizes a library like `multer` to parse and save the uploaded file temporarily.
- **Controller Function**: `uploadImage`:
    - Handles the business logic for storing the uploaded image to Cloudinary and saving its metadata in the database.
    - Sends a response indicating whether the upload was successful.

---

### **4. Route: Fetch Images**
```javascript
router.get("/images", authMiddelware, getImages);
```
#### **Route Details**:
- **HTTP Method**: `GET`.
- **Path**: `/images`.
- **Middleware**:
    - **`authMiddleware`**:
        - Ensures the user is logged in.
        - Prevents unauthorized users from accessing image data.
- **Controller Function**: `getImages`:
    - Retrieves image metadata from the database.
    - Supports pagination, sorting, and limits the number of images retrieved per request.
    - Sends a response with the fetched images and metadata (like total pages and current page).

---

### **5. Route: Delete Image**
```javascript
router.delete("/delete/:id", authMiddelware, adminMiddleware, deleteImage);
```
#### **Route Details**:
- **HTTP Method**: `DELETE`.
- **Path**: `/delete/:id`.
    - **`:id`**: Dynamic URL parameter representing the unique ID of the image to be deleted.
- **Middleware**:
    1. **`authMiddleware`**:
        - Ensures the user is logged in.
    2. **`adminMiddleware`**:
        - Restricts access to admin users who are authorized to delete images.
- **Controller Function**: `deleteImage`:
    - Handles the deletion of the image from:
        - Cloudinary (via its `publicId`).
        - The database (via its unique ID).
    - Ensures the user deleting the image is the one who uploaded it (or is an admin).
    - Sends an appropriate success or error response.

---

### **6. Exporting the Router**
```javascript
module.exports = router;
```
- Exports the `router` so it can be used in other parts of the application.
- Typically, this router will be mounted in the main application file (e.g., `app.js`) using:
  ```javascript
  const imageRoutes = require("./routes/imageRoutes");
  app.use("/api/images", imageRoutes);
  ```

---

### **Summary of Functionality**
This router provides the following functionality for handling images:
1. **Uploading Images** (`POST /upload`):
    - Restricts access to admin users.
    - Uploads a single image and saves metadata.
2. **Fetching Images** (`GET /images`):
    - Allows authenticated users to fetch images with support for pagination and sorting.
3. **Deleting Images** (`DELETE /delete/:id`):
    - Restricts access to admin users.
    - Deletes an image after verifying ownership or admin privileges.

### **Why Modular Design?**
1. **Separation of Concerns**:
    - Middleware handles authentication, file uploads, and role checks independently.
    - Controllers focus on core business logic.
2. **Code Reusability**:
    - Middleware and controllers can be reused in other routes if necessary.
3. **Scalability**:
    - Easy to extend by adding new routes or modifying existing functionality without affecting unrelated parts.
