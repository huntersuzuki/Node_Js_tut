Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the code:

---

### **1. Importing the `express` module**
```javascript
const express = require("express");
```
- **Express**: A Node.js framework used to build web applications and APIs efficiently.
- The `express` module is imported to set up and manage the server.

---

### **2. Creating an Express application**
```javascript
const app = express();
```
- **`app`**: An instance of an Express application.
- This object is used to define middleware, routes, and the overall application logic.

---

### **3. Middleware Function: Logging Requests with Timestamp**
```javascript
const requestTimeStampLogger = (req, res, next) => {
  const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
  console.log(`${timeStamp} from ${req.method} to ${req.url}`);
  next();
};
```
#### **What is Middleware?**
- Middleware is a function that executes during the request-response lifecycle.
- It has access to the **request (`req`)**, **response (`res`)**, and a **`next` function** to pass control to the next middleware or route handler.

#### **Explanation of the Middleware Logic:**
1. **Get Current Timestamp**:
    - `new Date().toISOString()` generates the current date and time in ISO format (e.g., `"2025-01-13T12:45:30.123Z"`).
2. **Log Request Information**:
    - Logs the timestamp, HTTP method (`req.method`), and URL (`req.url`) to the console.
    - Example log for a GET request to `/`:
      ```
      2025-01-13T12:45:30.123Z from GET to /
      ```
3. **Pass Control**:
    - `next()` is called to pass control to the next middleware or route handler in the stack.

---

### **4. Using the Middleware**
```javascript
app.use(requestTimeStampLogger);
```
- **`app.use(middleware)`**:
    - Attaches the `requestTimeStampLogger` middleware globally to the application.
    - This means the middleware will run for **all incoming requests**, regardless of the route or method.

---

### **5. Defining Routes**
#### **Home Page (`/`)**
```javascript
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Home page");
});
```
- **Route**: Handles GET requests to `/`.
- **Response**: Sends the text `"Home page"` to the client.

#### **About Us Page (`/aboutus`)**
```javascript
app.get("/aboutus", (req, res) => {
  res.send("About us page");
});
```
- **Route**: Handles GET requests to `/aboutus`.
- **Response**: Sends the text `"About us page"` to the client.

---

### **6. Starting the Server**
```javascript
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server working on port 3000");
});
```
- **`app.listen(port, callback)`**:
    - Starts the server on port `3000`.
    - Executes the callback function to log a confirmation message:
      ```
      Server working on port 3000
      ```

---

### **How the Application Works**

#### **Request Flow:**
1. **Incoming Request**:
    - A client sends a request to the server (e.g., GET `/` or GET `/aboutus`).
2. **Middleware Execution**:
    - The `requestTimeStampLogger` middleware runs:
        - Logs the request details (timestamp, method, and URL).
        - Passes control to the next handler using `next()`.
3. **Route Handling**:
    - The appropriate route handler (`app.get()`) processes the request and sends the response (`res.send()`).

---

### **Output Examples**

#### **Request 1: GET `/`**
- **Console Output**:
  ```
  2025-01-13T12:45:30.123Z from GET to /
  ```
- **Browser or Client Response**:
  ```
  Home page
  ```

#### **Request 2: GET `/aboutus`**
- **Console Output**:
  ```
  2025-01-13T12:45:32.456Z from GET to /aboutus
  ```
- **Browser or Client Response**:
  ```
  About us page
  ```

### **Key Concepts Illustrated**
1. **Middleware**:
    - Demonstrates how middleware can intercept and process requests.
    - Middleware is a powerful way to handle common tasks like logging, authentication, and error handling.

2. **Request-Response Flow**:
    - Middleware runs first, followed by route handlers.

3. **Dynamic Logging**:
    - The `requestTimeStampLogger` middleware provides real-time information about each request for monitoring or debugging purposes.

4. **Global Middleware**:
    - Middleware applied using `app.use()` runs for every request, regardless of the route or method.

This code is a practical example of how middleware can be used to log request details in a Node.js application built with Express.
