Here’s a detailed explanation of the code:

---

### **1. Importing the `express` module**
```javascript
const express = require("express");
```
- **Express** is a Node.js web application framework that provides tools and functionalities to create web servers and APIs.

---

### **2. Creating an Express application**
```javascript
const app = express();
```
- **`app`** is an instance of an Express application.
- This is used to define application settings, routes, middleware, and error handling.

---

### **3. Setting up application-level settings**
```javascript
app.set("view engine", "ejs");
```
- **`app.set(settingName, value)`**:
    - Configures application-wide settings.
    - `"view engine"`: Specifies the template engine for rendering dynamic views.
    - `"ejs"`: Indicates that the application will use the **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)** template engine for server-side rendering of views (though no views are used in this specific code).

---

### **4. Defining routes**
#### **4.1. GET Route for `/`**
```javascript
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Home Page");
});
```
- **`app.get(path, callback)`**:
    - Defines a route to handle GET requests to the specified `path`.
    - **Path**: The root URL `/` (home page).
    - **Callback Function**:
        - `req`: Represents the incoming request.
        - `res`: Used to send a response back to the client.
    - **`res.send("Home Page")`**:
        - Sends a plain-text response `"Home Page"` when the root URL `/` is accessed.

#### **4.2. POST Route for `/api/data`**
```javascript
app.post("/api/data", (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    success: true,
    message: "Data received",
    data: req.body,
  });
});
```
- **`app.post(path, callback)`**:
    - Defines a route to handle POST requests to `/api/data`.
    - **Response**:
        - `res.json()` sends a JSON object as the response.
        - The response includes:
            - `success`: A boolean indicating the request was successful.
            - `message`: A confirmation message (`"Data received"`).
            - `data`: Contains the request body (`req.body`). However, this requires middleware like `express.json()` to parse the request body. This part might not work properly unless such middleware is added.

---

### **5. Middleware for error handling**
```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.log(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send("Something went wrong");
});
```
- **`app.use((err, req, res, next) => { ... })`**:
    - Defines a global error-handling middleware.
    - Triggered whenever there’s an error in the application.
- **Parameters**:
    - `err`: Represents the error object.
    - `req`: The request object.
    - `res`: The response object.
    - `next`: A function to pass control to the next middleware (not used here).
- **Error Handling**:
    - Logs the error stack trace using `console.log(err.stack)`.
    - Sends a `500 Internal Server Error` response with the message `"Something went wrong"`.

---

### **6. Starting the server**
```javascript
const port = 3000;

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running at ${port}`);
});
```
- **`app.listen(port, callback)`**:
    - Starts the server and listens for incoming requests on the specified `port` (3000 in this case).
    - Logs a message when the server starts successfully:
      ```
      Server is running at 3000
      ```

---

### **How the application works together**:
1. **Home Page (`/`)**:
    - If a user sends a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/`, the server responds with `"Home Page"`.

2. **API Route (`/api/data`)**:
    - If a user sends a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/api/data`, the server responds with a JSON object:
      ```json
      {
        "success": true,
        "message": "Data received",
        "data": {} // depends on the request body
      }
      ```
    - Note: To fully handle request bodies, middleware like `express.json()` is required (not included in this code).

3. **Error Handling**:
    - If an error occurs anywhere in the application, the error-handling middleware logs the error and sends a `500 Internal Server Error` response.

---

### **Output Example**:
#### **1. GET `/`**:
- Browser or API client response:
  ```
  Home Page
  ```

#### **2. POST `/api/data` (without request body parsing middleware)**:
- API client response:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Data received",
    "data": {}
  }
  ```

#### **3. Error Occurrence**:
- If an error occurs, the terminal logs the error stack, and the client receives:
  ```
  Something went wrong
  ```

---

### **Key Improvement**:
To handle request bodies in the POST route, add this middleware before defining routes:
```javascript
app.use(express.json());
```
This parses incoming JSON request bodies and makes them available in `req.body`.
